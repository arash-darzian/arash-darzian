‚õ≥ I am currently working on building up my Github profile with data science projects.

‚õΩ I am learning the basic of Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

‚õè I am open to collaborate on bioinformatics projects, data science projects or open to other related projects.

üéµ Fun fact: I love to listen to 70s rock music while I am coding or I'm not!



### Background
I'm graduated from University of Tehran with a Master of Science in Biotechnology. After graduation, I worked at different companies and during years, I have developed a new passion for programming becuase I felt that tasks can be done in a timely and efficient manner. I started using Python more often in order to improve my skills. I enjoyed automating tasks that we commonly complete manually.  My team definitely appreciate that. As a result, I decided to explore this way and currently, I am a MSc **bioinfomatics** student at **Lund University**.
