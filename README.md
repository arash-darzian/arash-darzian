# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on building up my GitHub profile with data science projects.<br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  bioinformatics ML projects.<br>💬 Ask me about Python, Linux, R<br>⚡ Fun fact: I love to listen to 70s rock music while I am coding or I'm not!

# Background
I'm graduated from University of Tehran with a Master of Science in Biotechnology. After graduation, I worked at different companies and during years, I have developed a passion for programming becuase I felt that tasks can be done in a timely and efficient manner. I started using Python more often in order to improve my skills. I enjoyed automating tasks that we commonly complete manually.  My team definitely appreciate that. As a result, I decided to explore this way and currently, I am a MSc **bioinfomatics** student at **Lund University**.
